// By the end of this lesson, you should be able to do the following:

// Write an object constructor and instantiate the object.
// Describe what a prototype is and how it can be used.
// Explain prototypal inheritance.
// Understand the basic do’s and don’t’s of prototypical inheritance.
// Explain what Object.create does.
const myObject = {
  property: 'Value!',
  otherProperty: 77,
  "obnoxious property": function() {
    // do stuff!

}

// example one
const playerOneName = "tim"
const playerTwoName = "jenn"
const playerOneMarker = "X"
const playerTwoMarker = "O"

// example two

// When you have a specific type of object that you need to duplicate like our player or inventory items a better way to create them 
// is using an object constructor, which is a function that looks like this:

function Player(name, marker) {
  this.name = name
  this.marker = marker
}
const player = new Player('steve', 'X')
console.log(player.name) // 'steve'
// Just like with objects created using the Object Literal method you can add functions to the object:
function Player(name, marker) {
  this.name = name
  this.marker = marker
  this.sayName = function() {
    console.log(name)
  }
}

const player1 = new Player('steve', 'X')

//prototype notes 
function PrintStuff (myDocuments) {
this.documents = myDocuments;
}

// We add the print () method to PrintStuff prototype property so that other instances (objects) can inherit it:
PrintStuff.prototype.print = function () {
console.log(this.documents);
}

// Create a new object with the PrintStuff () constructor, thus allowing this new object to inherit PrintStuff's properties and methods.
var newObj = new PrintStuff ("I am a new Object and I can print.");

// newObj inherited all the properties and methods, including the print method, from the PrintStuff function. Now newObj can call print directly, even though we never created a print () method on it.
newObj.print (); //I am a new Object and I can print.
//Constructor
    // Before we continue, let’s briefly examine the constructor. A constructor is a function used for initializing new objects, 
    // and you use the new keyword to call the constructor.
    // For example:
function Account () {
}
// This is the use of the Account constructor to create the userAccount object.
var userAccount = new Account (); 
//Moreover, all objects that inherit from another object also inherit a constructor property. 
//And this constructor property is simply a property (like any variable) that holds or points to the constructor of the object.
//The constructor in this example is Object () 
var myObj = new Object ();
// And if you later want to find the myObj constructor:
console.log(myObj.constructor); // Object()

// Another example: Account () is the constructor
var userAccount = new Account (); 
// Find the userAccount object's constructor
console.log(userAccount.constructor); // Account()

// Prototype Attribute of Objects Created with new Object () or Object Literal:
    // All objects created with object literals and with the Object constructor inherits from Object.prototype. 
    // Therefore, Object.prototype is the prototype attribute (or the prototype object) of all objects created with new Object () or with {}. 
    // Object.prototype itself does not inherit any methods or properties from any other object.
    // The userAccount object inherits from Object and as such its prototype attribute is Object.prototype.
var userAccount = new Object ();

// This demonstrates the use of an object literal to create the userAccount object; the userAccount object inherits from Object; therefore, its prototype attribute is Object.prototype just as the userAccount object does above.
var userAccount = {name: 'Mike'};
console.log(userAccount)
// Prototype Attribute of Objects Created With a Constructor Function
    // Objects created with the new keyword and any constructor other than the Object () constructor, get their prototype from the constructor function. 
    // For Example:

function Account () {

}
var userAccount = new Account () // userAccount initialized with the Account () constructor and as such its prototype attribute (or prototype object) is Account.prototype.
console.log(userAccount)

/*So, there are two general ways an object’s prototype attribute is set when an object is created:

If an object is created with an object literal (var newObj = {}), 
    it inherits properties from Object.prototype and we say its prototype object (or prototype attribute) is Object.prototype.
If an object is created from a constructor function such as new Object (), new Fruit () or new Array () or new Anything (), 
    it inherits from that constructor (Object (), Fruit (), Array (), or Anything ()). For example, with a function such as Fruit (), each time we create a new instance of Fruit (var aFruit = new Fruit ()), the new instance’s prototype is assigned the prototype from the Fruit constructor, which is Fruit.prototype.Any object that was created with new Array () will have Array.prototype as its prototype. An object created with new Fruit () will have Fruit.prototype as its prototype. And any object created with the Object constructor (Obj (), such as var anObj = new Object() ) inherits from Object.prototype.
It is important to know that in ECMAScript 5, you can create objects with an Object.create() method that allows you to set the new object’s prototype object. 
We will cover ECMAScript 5 in a later post.*/
function Plant () {
this.country = "Mexico";
this.isOrganic = true;
}

// Add the showNameAndColor method to the Plant prototype property
Plant.prototype.showNameAndColor =  function () {
console.log("I am a " + this.name + " and my color is " + this.color);
}

// Add the amIOrganic method to the Plant prototype property
Plant.prototype.amIOrganic = function () {
if (this.isOrganic)
console.log("I am organic, Baby!");
}

function Fruit (fruitName, fruitColor) {
this.name = fruitName;
this.color = fruitColor;
}

// Set the Fruit's prototype to Plant's constructor, thus inheriting all of Plant.prototype methods and properties.
Fruit.prototype = new Plant ();

// Creates a new object, aBanana, with the Fruit constructor
var aBanana = new Fruit ("Banana", "Yellow");

// Here, aBanana uses the name property from the aBanana object prototype, which is Fruit.prototype:
console.log(aBanana.name); // Banana

// Uses the showNameAndColor method from the Fruit object prototype, which is Plant.prototype. The aBanana object inherits all the properties and methods from both the Plant and Fruit functions.
console.log(aBanana.showNameAndColor()); // I am a Banana and my color is yellow.
/*
Note that the showNameAndColor method was inherited by the aBanana object even though it was defined all the way up the prototype chain on the Plant.prototype object.

Indeed, any object that uses the Fruit () constructor will inherit all the Fruit.prototype properties and methods and all the properties and methods from the Fruit’s prototype, 
which is Plant.prototype. 
This is the principal manner in which inheritance is implemented in JavaScript and the integral role the prototype chain has in the process.

var myFriends = {name: "Pete"};

// To find the name property below, the search will begin directly on the myFriends object 
// and will immediately find the name property because we defined the property name on the myFriend object. This could be thought of as a prototype chain with one link.
console.log(myFriends.name);

// In this example, the search for the toString () method will also begin on the myFriends’ object, but because we never created a toString method on the myFriends object, 
// the compiler will then search for it on the myFriends prototype (the object which it inherited its properties from).

// And since all objects created with the object literal inherits from Object.prototype, 
// the toString method will be found on Object.prototype—see important note below for all properties inherited from Object.prototype. 

myFriends.toString ();

//another example"
function People () {
this.superstar = "Michael Jackson";
}
// Define "athlete" property on the People prototype so that "athlete" is accessible by all objects that use the People () constructor.
People.prototype.athlete = "Tiger Woods";

var famousPerson = new People ();
famousPerson.superstar = "Steve Jobs";

// The search for superstar will first look for the superstar property on the famousPerson object, and since we defined it there, that is the property that will be used. 
// Because we have overwritten the famousPerson’s superstar property with one directly on the famousPerson object, the search will NOT proceed up the prototype chain. 
console.log (famousPerson.superstar); // Steve Jobs

// Note that in ECMAScript 5 you can set a property to read only, and in that case you cannot overwrite it as we just did.

// This will show the property from the famousPerson prototype (People.prototype), since the athlete property was not defined on the famousPerson object itself.
console.log (famousPerson.athlete); // Tiger Woods

// In this example, the search proceeds up the prototype chain and find the toString method on Object.prototype, from which the Fruit object inherited—all objects ultimately inherits from Object.prototype as we have noted before.
console.log (famousPerson.toString()); // [object Object]
